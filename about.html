                                in
                                the precious materials he uses. In his hands, gold and platinum are folded, forced and
                                twisted to create a tension that evokes the inherent rhythm of the metal.</h2>

                        <p>Diamonds are dynamic: encircled by the curving lines of each piece, they are part of an
                            action that speaks of movement and growth. Although not directly influenced by the natural
                            world, LEEN HEYNE jewels harness the complexity of organic forms. At once ephemeral and
                            strong, they invoke a powerful calm. His diamond and gold rings may remind you of the
                            exposed roots of a tree winding around a rock. The simple elegance of his designs - soft but
                            never silent - are intended to leave the door wide open to interpretation, allowing the
                            beauty of storytelling to unfold in the mind of each wearer.

                        <p>The life of a LEEN HEYNE jewel invariably starts with a single strip of precious metal. In
                            his studio in Tilburg, located in the Dutch province of Brabant, HEYNE places a passionate
                            focus on the rich nature of this material. Each sweeping bend, twist, and turn is the result
                            of a very balanced approach, achieved through manual dexterity and physically forced. His
                            pieces are patterned with ultra-fine lines, the result of a meticulous sanding process.
                            HEYNE's savoir-faire is rooted in his desire to reflect an inner truth, which is further
                            enhanced by an absence of decoration. Once the gold has found its new form, there is no fuss
                            – it retains a sense of earthiness and authenticity.

                            Diamonds are introduced when the strip of gold or platinum is being modeled, never after.
                            The gems are not fixed in place by traditional prongs or settings. Instead, they are caught
                            in a metallurgic dance of tension. They are held in place as if by magic. This rare
                            technique is rooted in the belief that materiality possesses its own language, which
                            ultimately reveals itself to Heyne through the making process allowing him to embolden and
                            enrich it in its most evocative form.
